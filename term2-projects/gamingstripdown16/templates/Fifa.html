  <h1 style="text-align:center">Fifa 16</h1>
  <p style="text-align:center">Hi. I'm Eshaan and Fifa 16 is my favorite Xbox game. I love Fifa 16 because I like soccer and I like the various playing modes that Fifa has. My favorite mode is the career mode. In career mode you make your own player and put him own your favorite team. It is really cool because you can make you player look just like you, or anyone really. You also get to name them. Then you can put them on your favorite team. You get to sign contracts, you get a salery, and you can buy shoes,jerseys, and other things. It is like living an athlete life... from your couch! My player plays for Barcelona. My second favorite mode is season mode. In season mode, you get to play as your favorite team and lead them through seasons and tournaments. When I play season mode I like playing as Arsenal because they have cool jerseys. But when I play with friends I like to play Kickoff mode because you can pick any team in the world and pair it with an equally good team. It keeps the game fair and fun. My favorite team in Kickoff mode is Bayern Munich. A popular game mode is Ultimate Team. I myself don't play it because it can get boring, you can only get players in packs unless you have Facebook, and it is really hard. The game always puts you against hard teams that are five times better than yours. Below are some videos and pictures of Fifa.</p>
