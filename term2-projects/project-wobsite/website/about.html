							<h1>About us, and the site</h1>
							<p>This site was created during the Duke TiP Web Applications Development course at Trinity University. The site has no point, Alex, but seems to be a halfhearted attempt at a minigame website. There ought to be a point, and we shall be developing that from now on.<br><br>No, who are we kidding, this'll never get a point.</p>
							<h2>Alex</h2>
							<p>Is a good programmer and a very human hooman. <br> No, but seriously, he is currently in <code>%currentGrade%</code>th grade, and is also probably either sleeping, eating, reading???, doing math, playing videogames, or pogromming right now. That, or he's off getting himself killed. He currently has not made his computer explode, but it's only a matter of time.<br><br>No, I'm not kidding, he wrote a program just for this purpose.<br><br> He's from Austin, Texas, and may or may not have an <span id="under" title="read: cookies">Unsuspicious Package</span> in his backpack.</p>
							<h2>Yovel</h2>
							<p>Has signed a non-disclosure agreement with himself. <br> He is in 8th grade (kinda), enjoys programming, gaming, swimming?, writing?? and reading???, and is wearing a black shirt right now.<br><br>No, seriously, that's literally all he wears.<br><br>He also is technically a JS noob, as he's never written a Hello World. He lives in Houston, Texas, and lives with more than three dozen people in a fifty-mile radius.</p>
							<h2>Duke TiP</h2>
							<p>Is a talent search-y thing where they find kids good at stuff and give them lots of opportunities to do that stuff, and sometimes stuff slightly irrelevant to that stuff.<br>And also forces kids to take the SAT.<br><br>Okay, if you wanted a formal explanation, you should've just gone <a href="https://tip.duke.edu/node/11" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
							<h2>Prassel Hall</h2>
							<p>Is a place where people pay $4000 to go to for three weeks to learn all sorts of different things.<br><br> And also get <span id="under" title="PUDDINGGGGG~~~~">free pudding</span> from the dining hall.</p><br>
